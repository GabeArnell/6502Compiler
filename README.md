# 6502Compiler
Browser App for Compilers class

This is a browser app writen in TypeScript, compiled into JS for usage. The sourcecode typescript is in the src folder and compiles into the /dist/js folder.

The test cases document is in
CodeGenTestCases.txt
But the test cases (and the actual code for the test cases) is accessible via the test cases dropdown menu, or the TestCases.ts in the src folder.

COMPILING THE APP

All sourcecode is in the src folder and compiles to the dist. Some files for css or html only exist in the dist folder as they do not come from a .ts file. So don't forget to bring that folder in as well if you want to compile. 



USING THE APP

Everything needed to run the app is in the dist folder. To run, download the dist folder and open the index.html in a browser. 
When functional, source code will be written into the top left text box. 
Clicking the 'compile' button will compile the program, logging output to the topleft box and printing the final machine code in the bottom text area.
The 'clear' button will erase the log and machinecode text boxes.
